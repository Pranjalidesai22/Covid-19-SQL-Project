This project explores COVID-19 data using SQL, analyzing global trends, case growth, vaccination rates, and mortality rates. The objective is to uncover meaningful insights from the dataset to understand the pandemic’s impact across different regions.

 **Objective**

Using SQL, I performed data exploration to analyze:

Global COVID-19 Cases & Deaths 📊
Mortality Rate Analysis ☠️
Vaccination Trends & Coverage 💉
Country-wise & Continent-wise Impact 🌍

**Tools & Technologies**

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL/SQL Server)
Data Analysis 
Data Visualization (Tableau/Power BI for future enhancements)

**Key Insights**

Identified countries with the highest infection and death rates.
Analyzed vaccination progress and its correlation with case reduction.
Evaluated mortality trends across different time periods.

**Future Enhancements**
